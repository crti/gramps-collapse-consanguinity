GRAMPS Gramplet to show pedigree collapse and spousal consanguinuity for active person.

Link to Wiki for original Gramplet
https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Addon:Consanguinity_Gramplet

This is fork by user with no proper Python/coding experience, so this is in Alpha testing phase with first goals:
- Proper output in second language German
- Reference to the number of generations to the collapse
- Statistics about the number and percent of collapse in any ancestral generation (maybe in a report) 
Brute Hacking and Third Party Help inlcuding AI might be used.
